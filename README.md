# Face_recognition_AttendanceProject
# This project is based on Face Recognition and uses Python and OpenCV. It is Attendance Tracker which recognises the faces and then add name and time in excel/csv form.
# Pycharm was used to execute the code and many libraries like face_recognition, OpenCV, numpy, datetime were imported to run the code.
# Their are two python files one is main.py which contains basic facial recognition code which will allow you to recognise the faces and give result whether it is true or false and other is attendance python file which will recognise the person and will give distance and will save the name and time of recognition in csv file which is Attendance.csv file.
